**Basics of TLS**

Steps of TLS connection :

1. Cipher suite Decision: client tells available cyphers, server decides.
2. Certificate: sent by server, validated by client.
3. Session keys: generated by client:
	1. encrypted with server PK (no PFS) or 
	2. signed Diffie-Helman (PFS).

What could I do as an attacker ?

1. If I can intercept decision traffic: I can choose the weakest cipher suite, like MD5, and facilitate further attacks, or send non compatible suite and prevent connection.
2. If I can fake a certificate: MiM attack, client now communicates with the wrong server, everything is compromised.
3. 
	1. If I can break RSA: Can get the session keys and read all traffic.
	2. If Can break the D-H exchange ( https://weakdh.org/imperfect-forward-secrecy-ccs15.pdf ), can get the key and read all traffic.

What can I actually do ?
1. Yes ?
2. Maybe (Attack the CA) ?
3.
	1. No
	2. Maybe (NSA) ?

**What analysis can be done, given a URL ?**

Verifiy TLS version used.

1. Make sure only the strongest ciphers are used.
2. Careful analysis of the certificate, 
	1. Check validity.
	2. Which autority issued it (Google > Let's encrypt). 
	3. Compare with recent breaches of CA companies.
	4. Check for inconsistencies (Google should not be issuing certificates for Facebook).
3. Ask for TLS implementation and only use validated ones.

**Conclusion: weigh the answers and create a score for the URL. Raise alerts when relevant**
